# Python Analytics Quest.

Our mission: to code a text-based game, ‘Escape Room’, using Python skills learned in the bootcamp. 
By doing this, we’ll reinforce Python theory, enhance teamwork, and problem-solving skills.

## Project Overview (structure, functions, features)

Our team will develop the “Escape Room” game. Implement Python code, manage errors, and test the game to ensure robustness. Each room presents unique challenges. The goal is to escape from the starting room (Game Room) to the end (Outside). Look at the image below and read the game narrative to understand the game logic fully:

###### Game Narrative

Suddenly, you find yourself waking up on an unfamiliar couch, in an eerie house. Your memory fails to provide any explanation about how you ended up here, or what transpired previously. You can sense an imminent threat lurking somewhere - your gut tells you to escape the house immediately!

### Additional Game Features 

We have added  some features, such as an indicator of the remaining time, and images of each room.
Will you meet any inhabitant of the mansion?

## Mistakes

![Mistakes](/images/Mistakes.jpg "Mistakes and learnings")

There is no need to be ashamed of mistakes, in fact, mistakes are great learning opportunities!

First, we wasted some time researching using some collaborative tool (visualStudio go Live) that initially seemed to work for us, but then stopped working, so we switched to Google Collab.

We learned that good knowledge of tools is crucial to improve work efficiency.

We also did complicated loops and a lot of user interactions, and learned that for a first project it might have been better to keep it a little bit simpler and clearer.
